   "question": "I would like to change universities, what do I need to do?",
   "answer": "If you intend to change universities, you should write an application for permission to transfer addressed to Ms. Dean and submit this application to the dean's office. At the dean's office you will also be able to pick up a certificate of student status (with the period of study, etc.) and a Study Progress Card listing all subjects and grades. You should write the application yourself, there are no ready-made forms."
