   "question": "Where to find applications?",
   "answer": "Most of the applications are on the departmental website. Here is a link to them - https://www.mat.umk.pl/web/wmii/aktualnosci-dziekanatu. If the application you need is not on the site you must go in person to the dean's office and ask for it."
