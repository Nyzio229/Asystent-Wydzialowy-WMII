   "question": "How do I book a room or check room reservations?",
   "answer": "To check room reservations go to this address https://www.mat.umk.pl/group/wmii/rezerwacje-sal. Here you can, after logging in with your departmental data, see which room is registered at any given time. You can also request reservations for the room of your choice by pressing the envelope icon during the hours you are interested in. You will be asked to justify the need for the reservation."
