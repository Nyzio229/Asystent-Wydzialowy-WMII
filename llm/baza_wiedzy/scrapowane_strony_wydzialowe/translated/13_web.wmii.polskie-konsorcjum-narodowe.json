      "page_content": "Purchased AMS - \"Mathematical Reviews\" databases were made available on December 16, 2010 by AMS. The MathSciNet database is seated in the USA. Its use is based on the use of the graphical interface of the user's computer. Windows Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera or Google Chrome programs accessible from any of the Windows, Unix and Mac OSX operating systems can be used. Access to the database is via the Internet with verification of IP addresses of users' computers.\n\nIn practice, the databases are accessible to all mathematical institutions in Poland and all Polish mathematicians. This is because anyone can use MathSciNet in the central mathematics library at IM PAN in Warsaw and environmentally in the libraries of the Institutes of Mathematics.\n\nThe Consortium brings together 42 mathematical institutions and the license purchased by the Consortium is used by more than 60 departments and institutes. The license agreement with AMS does not limit the number of IP addresses under which the MathSciNet database is made available to member institutions. On this basis, the database is also made available to the following institutions:\n* the university's main libraries and departmental libraries, and through them to all interested university students,\n* all departments and institutes of the university interested in using this database (in particular, institutes of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, econometrics).\n\nThis principle should be implemented in all universities, polytechnics and PAS, and in particular at UW, UJ, UWr, UMK, UAM, UŁ, UŚl, UWM, UKW, PW, PWr, AGH, PŚ.\n\nPlease spread this possibility among the organizational units of universities where mathematicians have access to MathSciNet. Extension of IP addresses within a university does not require additional fees (it is enough to electronically send a request to the Consortium address konsorc@mat.umk.pl).",

      "page_content": "On March 15, 1998, the *Polish Mathematical Reviews National Consortium* is formed as an agreement of Polish mathematical institutions interested in accessing the Mathematical Reviews databases made available for a fee by the American Mathematical Society AMS under the terms established by the AMS.\n\nThe Consortium consists of institutions which have sent to the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun written declarations of joining the Consortium. The list of these institutions is Annex 1 to this agreement.\n\nThe Consortium *is represented* at home and abroad by *Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun*, and on its authority by *Dr. Krzysztof Frączek* - Chairman of the Consortium.\n\nThe purpose of the Consortium is to minimize the cost of purchasing Mathematical Reviews database licenses and to provide access to Mathematical Reviews databases to the majority of mathematical institutions in Poland for a low fee under the terms and conditions established by the AMS for National Consortia attached to this agreement.\n\nThe Consortium is open and may accept new members at any time.\n\nAccess to \"Mathematical Reviews\" databases is co-financed by the Ministry of Education and Science.",
