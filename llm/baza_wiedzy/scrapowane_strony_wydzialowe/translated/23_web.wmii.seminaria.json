We use this result to show several selector results, which generalize their partition counterparts. This includes a selector form of Weaver's KS_r conjecture for block diagonal trace class operators, which extends a selector result for Bessel sequences, or equivalently rank one matrices, due to Londner and the author. We also show a selector variant of Feichtinger's conjecture for a (possibly infinite) collection of Bessel sequences, extending earlier results for a single Bessel sequence. We prove a generalization of the R__epsilon conjecture of Casazza, Tremain, and Vershynin for infinite collection of equal norm Bessel sequences. In particular, our selector result yields a conjectured asymptotically optimal bound for a single Bessel sequence in terms of Riesz sequence tightness parameter.\n\n*Seminar of the Department of Nonlinear Mathematical Analysis*.\n10:15 - 11:45 a.m., room S3\n\n*Seminar of the Department of Computer Science*.\n12:00 - 14:00, room undetermined\n*Zeev Volkovich ( Software Engineering Department, Braude College of Engineering, Karmiel - Israel)*.\n*Detection of Suspicious Scientific Citation by Graph Self-Learning*.\n*WFAiIS, seminar room at COK.\nNote: WFAiIS, seminar room at COK.\nManipulated citations refer to instances where authors intentionally\nmanipulate or distort citation practices to serve their own interests.\nSuch references undermine the integrity of scholarly communication by\ndistorting the genuine impact, significance, and credibility of\nresearch findings. Traditional methods like manual checking and\nstatistical analysis have their limits in spotting complex citation\npatterns. Deep learning approaches have emerged promising techniques\nfor identifying and understanding citation manipulation.\nThis study presents a novel methodology for identifying potential\ncitation manipulation, leveraging self-learning-based disruptions of\ndeep embedding models. The approach benefits from the inherent\ncharacteristics of central relationships within a network by training a\ndeep network with partial data and reconstructing masked connections.\nIt aims to recover the meaningful connections represented by citations\nwithin the network by exploring slightly longer alternative paths.\nThese indirect pathways facilitate the recovery of original and\nreliable citations while assessing their trustworthiness.\nThrough numerical experiments, the methodology demonstrates a high\ncapability to identify reliable citations as the core of the analyzed\ndata while likewise raising suspicions about unreliable references.\n\n*Computer Science Seminar: Formal Languages and Concurrency*.\n12:00 - 14:00, room L9\n\n*Seminar of the Department of Differential Equations*.\n12:00 - 14:00, room SS2\n\n*Seminar of the Laboratory of Computer Science Teaching Methodology*.\n16:15 - 17:45, room L13\n*Anna Kwiatkowska (WMiI, UMK)*.\n*Digital transformation of education*.\nOne of the most important documents currently being developed by the Ministry of Education is the Digital Transformation of Education Policy, which describes from a meta-level the activities on the road to digital transformation of education in the face of the digital revolution. In each of ten closely related areas (called the Digital Decalogue), the document describes the diagnosis of the current state, the strategic goals of the transformation and the directions of intervention needed to realize the change. The short-term perspective extends to 2030, and the long-term to 2035. The actions needed to implement the policy will be described in the action plan and then detailed in the strategies. The seminar will discuss the most important planned activities that should change the face of today's school in an environment of ubiquitous digitization.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*** Wednesday, 24.04.2024 ***.\n*Mobile Technology Workshop Seminar*.\n16:00 -
