The aim is to *support outstandingly talented students in the development of their scientific activity, innovation, creativity*, which will be done by supporting their participation in international competitions, competitions or conferences.\n\n* *And in addition.\n\t* The department is part of *UMK (link: http://umk.pl/)* - the *fifth university* in the Ranking of Higher Education Schools of Perspektywa and Rzeczpospolita (link: http://www.perspektywy.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5074&Itemid=909) in 2012 in Poland, *the seventh university in the scientific ranking of Polish* *universities* by Polityka weekly in 2013 (link: http://www.polityka.pl/nauka/1543843,1,naukowy-ranking-uczelni-polityki-warszawski-przed-jagiellonskim.read)and 2014, (link: http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/nauka/1581127,1,ranking-uczelni-uw-pierwszy-uj--drugi.read) *fifth among universities and ninth among all state universities* in the 2014 Perspectives ranking.
