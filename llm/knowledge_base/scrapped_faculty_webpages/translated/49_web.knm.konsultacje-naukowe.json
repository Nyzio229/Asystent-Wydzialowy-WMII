From our own experience, we know that sometimes in classes there are concepts/issues that are difficult to understand, and the instructor, despite sincere intentions, speaks in a language that we do not understand. To meet these problems, we would like to offer you, colleagues, help in getting used to difficult material. We especially invite students of the first years of study, the beginnings at WMiI are sometimes a shock. You should make an appointment for consultations via faculty e-mail. It is possible to show up with a group at the consultation, but you should give advance notice in the message so that the consultant can reserve a room.\n\n* * *Wladyslaw Klinikowski:*.\n\n*Consultation topics:* analysis 1 and 2, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, introduction to mathematics/elements of logic and multiplicity theory, elementary mathematics/repetition in mathematics.\n*Consultation times:* by prior appointment via email.\n*Contact:* wklin@mat.umk.pl\n\n* *Kamil Dunst:*.\n\n*Consultation topics:* linear algebra, analysis I and II, elements of logic and multiplicity theory, introduction to mathematics.\n*Consultation times:* by prior appointment by email.\n*Contact:* globsztajn@mat.umk.pl\n\n* *Adam Konysz:*.\n\nConsultation topics: linear algebra, analysis I and II, differential equations.\n*Consultation times:* by prior appointment by email.\n*Contact:* adamkon@mat.umk.pl\n* *Lukasz Kotlewski:*.\n\nConsultation topics: linear algebra, analysis I and II, differential equations.\n*Consultation times:* by prior appointment by email.\n*Contact:* kotlewskilukasz@mat.umk.pl",
