Steinhaus).\n* A country without mathematics will not be able to withstand competition from those who do mathematics (H. Steinhaus).\n\n* And become a mathematician!\n* A mathematician will do better (H. Steinhaus).\n* The 2016 ranking of the best professions published by CareerCast (http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/jobs-rated-report-2016-ranking-200-jobs) included as many as four professions performed by mathematicians!\n* You can read about this ranking result at: http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/nauka/1583163,1,matematyka-pilnie-zatrudnie.read. Here is an excerpt:\n\n\"Widely quoted by all media overseas, the report predicts that *by 2022 the number of job opportunities for math graduates will increase by a quarter*.\"\n\n* *The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at UMK offers degree programs*.\n\t* *I degree* (bachelor's degree).\n\t* *II degree* (master's degree).\n\n* *Specialties*.\n\t* At both degrees we offer various specializations such as: *mathematics in economics and finance*, *teaching* specialties.\n\n* According to the latest ranking of the Perspektywy education portal, the Mathematics major was ranked 7th in the country (5th among majors taught at universities).\n* In 2017 - thanks to Mathematics - Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun was noted for the first time in the prestigious Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), one of the three most respected and most widely commented rankings of universities in the world. Indeed, UMK appeared in the so-called *Shanghai ranking. Shanghai *rankings* at position 301-400 in the natural sciences in the research area: MATHEMATICS (http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairan.../mathematics.html).\n* We *Teach:*.\n\t* the ability to think abstractly and analytically and to deepen knowledge independently.\n\t* use of modern information and communication technologies, including mathematical packages (*MAPLE*, *Matlab*, *SPSS*).\n\t* skills and impart mathematical knowledge to an extent that significantly exceeds the model learning outcomes for undergraduate mathematics courses announced by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.\n\n* *Your scientific development.\n\t* Toruń is one of the *leading mathematical centers* in the country.\n\t* we care about the scientific development of our students: the best ones are given *and**individual scientific care*.\n\t* they participate in seminars, conferences, international mathematical competitions.\n\t* active activity is carried out by the Scientific Circle of Mathematicians of UMK (link: http://knm.mat.umk.pl/KNM/) (link: http://knm.mat.uni.torun.pl/kolonaukowe/)\n\t* with a view to students interested in *scientific work*, *III degree* (doctoral) studies in mathematics are conducted.\n\n* *For those who are willing:*.\n\t* participation in running departmental events (link: https://www.mat.umk.pl/web/wmii/torunski-festiwal-nauki-i-sztuki-2017) organized within the framework of the Toruń Festival of Science and Arts (link: http://www.festiwal.torun.pl/) (volunteering).
