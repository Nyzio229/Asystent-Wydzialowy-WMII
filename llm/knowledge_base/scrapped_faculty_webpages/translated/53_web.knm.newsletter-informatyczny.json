This year's course was organized by students of teaching specialties: Kinga Krasinskaya, Paulina Zasuwa, Szymon Marchlewski, Bartosz Osenka, Jakub Wojtasik and doctoral student Kamil Palusiński.\nThe Tuesday meetings were attended by students from high schools in Toruń. For the past six months we have been repeating the material together before the May matriculation exam by solving high school graduation tasks from previous years. We ended our preparations with a trial \"semi-matura\", the results of which were very high. We wish each high school graduate the same and higher results on the actual exam. We thank the participants for their solid work and wish them good luck in the remaining exams and in their future life decisions!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*NOKIATHON competition finals***.\n*April 2, 2018*.\nOn March 9, 2018, KNM members Mikołaj Marciniak, Patrycja Tkaczuk and Michał Lewandowski took part in the finals of the programming competition organized by Nokia in Bydgoszcz.
