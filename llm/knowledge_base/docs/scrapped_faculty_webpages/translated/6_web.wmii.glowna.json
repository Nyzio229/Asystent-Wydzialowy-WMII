The meeting is open to all interested, but for organizational reasons, please register through the website: https://app.evenea.pl/event/meetitlive-14/. After the lecture, participants are invited to an integration meeting over coffee and pastries.\n\nLecture topics:\n\nDuring the lecture, we will not go into details of how each tool we use at Intel works. Instead, we'll focus on what validation is for, why it's not at all this \"inferior\" career path, why validation does not equal testing and who can make a career in validation. We will talk about several cases where validation was lacking and what the consequences were. I will talk about validation mainly from the perspective of Intel products and cyber security, but there will be examples from other fields.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nJakub Chilczuk - has been working at Intel for over 2 years, breaking things and pointing out bugs to developers. He currently works with Intel Xeon processors and previously with Intel Optane. Privately interested in and active with cyber security.\n\nAbout the company:\n\nIntel Corporation - an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, incorporated in the state of Delaware. Intel is one of the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue. Intel is not only processors, but also, for example, graphics cards, networking. It offers its employees fruit in the office all week, not just on Thursdays.\n\nmeetit.live are cyclical events in the form of evening lectures covering topics related to those undertaken at the UMK Department of Mathematics and Computer Science in all areas of study. We plan to meet every second Wednesday of the month. We hope that these meetings will provide an opportunity to get to know each other and integrate community members and supporters of our faculty.
