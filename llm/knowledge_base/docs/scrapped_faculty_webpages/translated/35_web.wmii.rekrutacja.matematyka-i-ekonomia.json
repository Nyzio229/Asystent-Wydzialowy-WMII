      "page_content": "The interdisciplinary study of *mathematics and economics* provides an opportunity to simultaneously master basic mathematical knowledge and the regularities of the functioning of the modern economy. Mathematical subjects will allow you to master mathematical tools, which will then find application in the analysis and interpretation of economic phenomena and processes. The interconnectedness of mathematics and economics is evidenced, for example, by the long list of Nobel Prize winners in economics whose initial field was mathematics. Economic subjects will provide interesting and concrete problems, the knowledge of which will be a good motivation for studying mathematical concepts and theories.\n* * *Why it is worth studying mathematics and economics at UMK.\n\t* In the course of three years, it is possible to simultaneously complete two majors: mathematics and economics, and obtain two diplomas.\n\t* Toru≈Ñ is one of the country's leading mathematics centers, the mathematics major received a distinction grade from the State Accreditation Commission in 2010, and in 2015 the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science received a positive institutional grade from the Polish Accreditation Commission.\n\t* The University is a leading research and teaching center in the field of economic sciences in Poland (as evidenced by high positions in rankings and the prestigious AACSB business accreditation received by the Faculty of Economics and Management).\n\t* Both Faculties have excellent premises, modern computer laboratories and lecture halls, well-equipped libraries.\n\t* Part of the studies can be held at foreign universities under the ERASMUS program.\n\n* * *Who can become after studying mathematics and economics?\n\t* The interdisciplinary study of mathematics and economics provides ample opportunities to choose the direction of further education in second-level studies.\n\t* Graduates of mathematics and economics at UMK find employment as, among others:\n\t\t* analysts of economic phenomena,\n\t\t* specialists in financial institutions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions (due to the ability to think analytically).\n\t\t* specialists in enterprises in various sectors of the economy.\n\t\t* employees of state and local administration offices\n\t\t* media commentators on economic phenomena and processes\n\t\t* specialists in statistical studies\n\n\t* The knowledge and skills acquired during the course of study provide the theoretical and practical basis necessary for launching and running one's own enterprise.\n\nPlan of study for mathematics and economics (link: https://www.mat.umk.pl/web/wmii/studia/matematyka-i-ekonomia)",
