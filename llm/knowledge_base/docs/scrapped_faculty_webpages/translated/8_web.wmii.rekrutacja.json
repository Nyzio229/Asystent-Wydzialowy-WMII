The aim is to *support outstandingly talented students in the development of their scientific activity, innovation, creativity*, which will be done by supporting their participation in international competitions, competitions or conferences.\n\n* *And in addition.\n\t* The Faculty is part of *UMK (link: http://umk.pl/)* - *the fifth university* in the 2012 Perspektywa and Rzeczpospolita Ranking of Higher Education Institutions in Poland, *the seventh university in the scientific ranking of Polish* *universities* by Polityka weekly in 2013 and 2014, *fifth among universities and ninth among all state universities* in the 2014 Perspectives ranking.\n\t* The Faculty building is located right next to (about 500 m) the beautiful *Stara Park* (link: http://www.torun.pl/pl/turystyka/tylko-w-toruniu/torunski-gotyk).\n\t* Access is easy (both for Torun residents and people from outside the city).\n\t* Planners arrange a friendly schedule :)",
