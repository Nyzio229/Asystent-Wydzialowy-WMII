Among others, KNM co-organizes the following events:\n* *City of (un)mathematical manifolds* The coordinators of the event are Mateusz Topolewski, MA, Bartosz Ziemkiewicz, PhD, and Bartosz Bieganowski, MA.\n*The Fortress of Ciphers.* The coordinators of the event are Daniel Strzelecki, MA, Aurelia Dymek, MA, and Piotr Górny, MA.\n\nIn addition, Aurelia Bartnicka, MA (a doctoral student at KNM) is co-organizer of the exhibition *Polish Space*, which features texts and paintings on Jozef Marcinkiewicz, the Polish school of mathematics and Polish mathematical objects. The exhibition was prepared by the following people: Aurelia Dymek, MA, Bogumiła Klemp-Dyczek, PhD, Joanna Karłowska-Pik, MA, Maurycy Rzymowski, MA, and Piotr Górny, MA.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The participation of the KNM in the scientific mathematics workshop (November, 2018)*.\nFrom 24.11 - 26.11.2018, members of the Scientific Circle of Mathematicians *Kamil Dunst* and *Mykolaj Marciniak* will participate in the conference \"*Small Horizons*\", which will be held at the center of the Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Będlewo. The workshop will feature speeches by 10 - 12 speakers from top universities in Poland. The lectures, which are an overview of the fields of mathematics, are addressed to first-year students contemplating a mathematical career path.\nFor more information, abstracts of the speeches and a registration form, visit the organizers' website.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*International Mathematics Olympiad in Mogilev (February, 2017)*.\nOn 22-24.02.2017 we held (for the first time) a scientific trip to Mogilev, Belarus. Members of the KNM circle (theoretical section) consisting of Ewelina Betlejewska-Szulc and Mikolaj Marciniak and supervisor Dr. Robert Skiba participated in the international mathematical competition: 8th Open Mathematical Olympiad of the Belarusian-Russian University (International Student Olympiad MathOpen 2017 Belarus).\nThe competition was held at the Belarusian-Russian University in Mogilev. The organizer of the competition was: State Institution of Higher Professional Education Belarusian-Russian University. During the competition, students had 30 tasks to solve in five hours. The competition is unusual in that students are not allowed to submit their solutions during the competition, but only their answers on a special sheet. Thus, if a student makes a mistake in calculations, the task is not credited. These are completely different competitions from those held in the Czech Republic or Bulgaria. This year we were \"scouting the area\". The KNM Circle plans to regularly participate in these competitions. Some statistical information about the competition: number of countries: 7 (Belarus, Czech Republic, Iran, Poland, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), number of Universities: 21, number of students: 46. In addition, there was a scientific seminar for student supervisors during their stay at the University. Supervisor of the KNM circle Dr. Robert Skiba gave a lecture entitled: \"A topological degree of Fuller type for periodic orbits\".\nSome photos from the trip can be found here (link: https://www.mat.umk.pl/web/knm/mogilev).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Noble Parcel for the sixth time at WMiI UMK (November, 2016)*.\nFor the sixth time, the Mathematics Study Circle and the Mathematics Applications Circle at WMiI UMK are organizing a collection for a needy family as part of the nationwide \"Noble Parcel\" campaign (http://www.szlachetnapaczka.pl/). The campaign runs from Monday, November 28 to Friday, December 9, 2016.\nThe baskets set up opposite the checkroom collect durable food, chemicals and hygiene products, as well as other items needed by the family.\nEspecially needed are cleaning products (laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, soap/washing gel, toothpaste, cleaning liquids, shampoo, \"Pinio 2-in-1\" baby shampoo) and food (tea, groats, sugar, canned meat, coffee, pasta, oil, canned fish, rice, flour, jam, canned vegetables, breakfast cereals, candy, fruit juices, vegetable juices).
