      "page_content": "* * *What are the differences between engineering and undergraduate studies in computer science?\n\t* The studies are similar, in engineering studies there are classes in physics, electronics and computer metrology, which gives more hardware preparation.\n\t* Basic differences:\n\t* engineering computer science takes 3.5 years. Graduates can continue their studies in a three-semester second degree program.\n\t* in the first year, the undergraduate program is no different from the program in engineering studies. By the beginning of the second year, there is an opportunity to change the decision of choice\n\t* in engineering studies the compulsory subjects are: Fundamentals of Physics (second year) and Fundamentals of Electronics and Computer Measurement - lecture and laboratory (third year).\n\t* classes in artificial intelligence (Introduction to Neural Networks) are compulsory in engineering studies; similar classes are offered (as an elective subject) in second-year studies to bachelor's graduates.\n\t* the engineering thesis is of a different nature than the thesis in undergraduate studies.\n\t* in undergraduate and engineering studies in the third year, students create an advanced programming project in teams of 5, often in cooperation with external companies. We want to make the projects even more closely related to industry in engineering studies\n\t* In engineering studies, work experience lasts 4 weeks, and in undergraduate studies - 3 weeks.\n\n* * Engineer = bachelor's degree + \"a few things\".\n\t* More or less. In engineering studies there is a little more practical subject matter - we want there to be more hardware issues.\n\t* An engineering degree is better recognized by employers than a bachelor's degree, although only a master's degree is more desirable to employers.\n\t* After bachelor's and engineering studies, it is possible to obtain a master's degree in computer science at the University of Science and Technology (2-year and 1.5-year studies). Graduates of engineering studies can continue their studies with a 3-semester master's degree. Recruitment takes place at the beginning of the calendar year.\n\n* * *Why are there a lot of mathematics classes during engineering studies?\n\t* There are as many of them as necessary to achieve the learning outcomes assigned to this field of study. At polytechnics, the number of hours of mathematics classes is usually slightly less, but the material is very similar (more time needs to be spent on your own work).\n\nPlan of study for computer science (link: https://www.mat.umk.pl/web/wmii/studia/informatyka)",
