      "page_content": "The Scientific Circle of Mathematicians (KNM) was founded in 2005 on the initiative of two mathematics students: Rafal Szefler and Maciej Karpicz. In agreement with the authorities of the Department and the University, Dr. Grzegorz Bobinski took care of it. During the meetings we are mainly concerned with learning about mathematics, we try to look with fascination at what is already known and long discovered, as well as try to create something new ourselves. KNM's program used to center around algebra and number theory. Currently, the Scientific Circle is involved in practically every branch of mathematics. Since the 2013/2014 academic year, our supervisor has been Mr. Dr. Robert Skiba. Our Circle is developing all the time. Its members share their interests by presenting papers on issues that interest them. They co-organize lectures on the scientific achievements of professors associated with mathematics in Toruń. For the past five years, the KNM, together with the Faculty Council, has organized the Toruń Summer School of Mathematics. Everyone - who is fascinated by mathematics and learns it not because they have to, but because they want to - is welcome. You are cordially invited!",
