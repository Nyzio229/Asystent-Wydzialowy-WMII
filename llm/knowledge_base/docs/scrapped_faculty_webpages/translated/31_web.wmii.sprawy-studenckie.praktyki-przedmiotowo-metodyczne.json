At the meeting with the faculty internship supervisor, the student receives the so-called Dean's letter to the Directorate with a request to accept the student for the internship.\n3) Then the document \"Consent of the School Directorate\" should be printed in its entirety (double-sided) (it contains a sample of the school management's consent to accept an intern and the rules of practice). On the first page you should fill in your data.\n4.With the above-mentioned documents (i.e., the template of , \"Consent...\" together with the rules and regulations and the , \"Letter from the Dean...\"), the student reports to the school of his choice with a request for admission to the internship.\n(5) The rules and regulations of the internship shall be given to the school management, while the \"Consent...\" completed and signed by the school director. the student shall deliver to the faculty internship supervisor by the designated date.\n(6) Prior to the start of the practice, the student is obliged to familiarize himself with the regulations of the practice, and in the course of the practice keep meticulous records.\n(7) In accordance with the Regulations of Continuous Subject-Methodical Practice in Mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, the basis for passing the practice is the delivery to the faculty supervisor of the practice by the designated date of:\n\t1. an observation notebook kept in accordance with the recommendation of the faculty practice supervisor;\n\t2. five, confirmed by the teacher's signature, handouts of lessons conducted;\n\t3. Completely filled out the following documents (to be printed from the subject practice page): ,,Journal of continuous practice in mathematics - longer/shorter version\", ,,Schedule of continuous practice in mathematics\" and ,,Teacher's opinion on the course of continuous practice in mathematics\".",
