The *analysis of large data sets* generated by information systems makes it possible to obtain information and conclusions desired by companies and institutions, often serving to improve the profitability of operations. Hence the high demand for *operational research* and *data analysis* specialists in the labor market. This is evident on online portals specializing in professional-business contacts (e.g. LinkedIn), or job portals. In the ranking of the best occupations in 2021 (link: https://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/best-jobs-2021?page=0) published by CareerCast, the first position was occupied by a data analyst, and the occupation of statistician was ranked third.\nIn the Applied Mathematics major, we *guarantee* a solid mathematical education with elements of computer science. As a graduate - a data analysis or operations research engineer, you will gain an advantage in the job market.\n*What does the study of applied mathematics give you?\n* Education in the applications of mathematics, primarily in data analysis and operations research, based on knowledge of the necessary mathematical foundations and selected computer science tools.\n* Ability to work on projects, including team projects.\n* A good occupation.\n\n*Program of study (link: https://www.mat.umk.pl/matematyka-stosowana)*.\n\n*It is worth studying Applied Mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Nicolaus Copernicus University because:*.\n* Torun is one of the country's leading mathematics centers in Poland - in 2017, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun was ranked for the first time in the prestigious ranking of universities in the world - the so-called Shanghai ranking - in the area of study: mathematics.\n* In 2022, the faculty of applied mathematics received a positive assessment by the Polish Accreditation Commission.\n* The most talented students are covered by individual scientific supervision.\n* We cooperate scientifically with leading mathematical centers in the world.\n\n*We offer excellent infrastructure:*.\n* Lecture and seminar rooms (including a modern auditorium for 350 people), computer laboratories, a student club and a bar. Some of these rooms are air-conditioned,\n* one of the best computer systems in Polish universities,\n* a well-equipped library with a reading room; it contains all the basic mathematical and computer literature needed by students during their studies.\n* full facilities for the disabled (ramps, elevator, toilets, adapted laboratories).\n\n*What after studying applied mathematics?\nA job awaits a graduate of applied mathematics, i.e. a data analysis engineer or operations research engineer, in positions that require the use of mathematical tools and methods and the ability to think independently and analytically. What counts is the ability to analyze large data sets, use statistical tools and methods, or the ability to solve optimization tasks in various decision-making situations, etc.\nThese types of specialists are sought after by: the financial, insurance, medical, industry, trade, statistical institutions, etc. The needs of the labor market in this area are enormous.\nAll engineering graduates are encouraged to upgrade their skills in higher degree programs.",
