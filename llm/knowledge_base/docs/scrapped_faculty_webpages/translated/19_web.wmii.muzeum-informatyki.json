Many of the exhibits have been received by the Museum as donations from employees and students of the Department, from private collections.\nWork on the establishment of the Computer Science Museum lasted from August 2010 to December 2011. The work involved the staff of the Computer System Operations Laboratory supported by the Faculty students who were among the administrators. They consisted of completing, cleaning and preparing for display equipment that was withdrawn from use many years ago.\nThe exhibit includes equipment such as personal computers, laptops, servers, network devices, printers, copiers, terminals, calculators, computer components and accessories.\nRecently, a room with a \"retro-style Internet cafe\" and an interactive presentation of 8-bit and 16-bit computers has been prepared. The launch of the room took place on April 21, 2012, during an event held at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science as part of the next edition of the Science and Arts Festival.",
