Faculty recruitment includes only those partner universities with which the faculty has inter-institutional agreements.\nThe list of foreign universities with which the department cooperates, the number of places and information on which students of which degrees and which specialties can go can be found here: http://www.mat.umk.pl/web/wmii/erasmus-1\nRecruitment for the trip takes place twice a year: in February-March (basic recruitment covering trips for the entire next academic year or any of its semesters) and in October (additional recruitment covering trips only for the summer semester of the current academic year).\nTo apply for recruitment, fill out and submit the application form, which is posted at http://www.umk.pl/wspolpraca/erasmus_plus/studenci-studia/dokumenty/.\nA copy of this form should also be submitted to the Dean's Representative for Mobility A. Zaigraev (alzaig@mat.umk.pl, room B306).\nIn this form, among other things, you should provide your data, contact information, and indicate up to three universities to which the student would like to go, with the first of the indicated universities being treated as a priority choice, and the second and third as an alternative in the event that a place is not granted at the center indicated first.\nAfter the recruitment deadline, the faculty committee will select students among those who applied. If there are more applicants than places, the grade point average of all exams and the degree of proficiency in a foreign language will be the deciding factor. In these cases, students may also be asked to submit a letter of application. In which the chosen center(s) should be indicated, along with a brief substantive justification for the choice made.\nA very detailed guide for a student going to study abroad, in which all the steps of the student starting from the submission of the application form and the granting of the qualification for the trip are dissected step by step, can be found here.\nThe guide for a student going on an internship can be found here.",
