The extremely important role of mathematics and computer science in the modern civilizational, cultural and economic reality imposes high requirements on the entire Faculty community.\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science sets itself the task of conducting scientific research in mathematics and computer science at the highest level, actively participating in international scientific activities and working closely with the world community of mathematicians and computer scientists. The Faculty considers it its duty to take care of the harmonious development of research in mathematics and computer science, to promote and disseminate research achievements through their publication in journals and monographs of international scope and the participation of its representatives in various forms of scientific activity, including conferences and symposia, and in the work of institutions responsible for the development of Polish mathematics and computer science, especially within the framework of the Polish Mathematical Society and the Polish Informatics Society. The Faculty considers it its duty to take up new research challenges and open new areas of scientific activity.\n* The faculty insists on a high level of scientific work as an indispensable part of the didactic process, in the belief that a university is a collective effort to think and do science in the presence and with the participation of students, respecting the principles and the master-student relationship (universitas magistrorum et scholarium), in which both parties have mutual respect and trust. Within the framework of its research activities, the Faculty creates conditions that enable the development of its research staff by organizing seminars and colloquia, and supporting and financing the efforts of young staff to obtain degrees and titles.\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science conducts full-time and part-time mathematics and computer science studies at the professional and master's level, doctoral studies, as well as postgraduate studies. The Faculty takes the necessary organizational measures to enable students and students to acquire sound mathematical and computer science knowledge beyond the framework of professional education, to support the formation of intellectual sensitivity and creative attitudes, and to prepare graduates for the necessity of further education and for competition in the labor market. This is fostered by the development of new and better curricula, constant attention to the appropriate level of technological facilities for the didactic process, the creation of conditions that allow the realization of individual educational programs, including the opportunity to combine majors or take up studies at other, including foreign universities. Special care of the Faculty surrounds the most talented students, treating them as future continuators of the work. The Faculty carries out its educational mission based on a rational understanding of the needs of the regional and national labor market.\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science represents an active educational attitude. It manifests itself in the readiness to support all activities aimed at the dissemination of mathematics and computer science and the increase in the level of education of the region's society. In particular, faculty members participate in the organization of the Olympiads: Mathematics and Computer Science and other competitions for schoolchildren and students. The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science also declares its readiness to cooperate with the authorities of Toru≈Ñ and the region in the organization of other educational undertakings in the field of mathematics and computer science.\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science is a community of academics, researchers, administrative staff and students, united by mutual respect, trust and solidarity. The principle of management at all levels is problem-solving, not formal function.\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science actively participates in the life of Nicolaus Copernicus University and influences the shape of the University's activities through its representatives in the Senate and other collegiate bodies of the University.\n\nResolution of the Council of the WMiI of the Nicolaus Copernicus University\nof November 14, 2001",
