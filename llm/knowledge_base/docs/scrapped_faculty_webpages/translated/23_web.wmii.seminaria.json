We also provide an example to establish that expansive homeomorphisms need not be bi-asymptotically expansive. Finally we prove decomposition theorems for bi-asymptotically c-expansive continuous surjective maps with the shadowing property on compact metric spaces. This talk is based on the joint-work with Tarun Das and Rohit Nageshwar.\n\n*Seminar by the Department of Nonlinear Mathematical Analysis*.\n10:15 am - 11:45 am, room S3\n*Adam Konysz (WMiI, UMK)*.\n*Semiclassical states for the curl-curl operator equation*.\n\n*Seminar on Computer Science*.\n12:00 - 14:00, room L9\n*Jerzy Białkowski*.\n*Algorithmic approach to selected problems in representation theory of algebras*.\nIn the paper I would like to present a proposed approach to problems from the\nrepresentation theory of algebras consisting in \"translation\" of problems\nformulated in the \"language\" of restricted quiver algebras into (solvable\neffectively solvable) problems in the theory of formal languages.\n\nIn particular, I will consider how one can \"choose\" an alphabet, how to\ndefine a language, how to construct a grammar and a system of term reduction.\nIn doing so, I will try to place particular emphasis on the choice of presentation of\nof data allowing to maintain an acceptable level of complexity\ntime and memory complexity.\n\nThe paper is intended mainly for those who have previously dealt with the\ndealing with the theory of formal languages (who have learned it to a degree of\nat least basic level), but who have not necessarily encountered before\nwith the theory of representations of algebras.Thus, the issues of the theory of\nrepresentations of algebras will be reduced to small \"slices\" for\nwhich, on the one hand, it will not take too long to give the necessary definitions\nmuch time, and which, on the other hand, will be necessary from the point of view of the\nthe paper.\n\nThe paper will largely take the form of a case study.\nMore on the theoretical basis (from the representation theory of algebras)\nand details of the algorithmic part (by design, the paper is to\nbe 1-part, so in this form it will not be possible to\ndevote too much time to them) can be found in the article\n\nJerzy Białkowski, An algorithm for the periodicity of deformed\npreprojective algebras of Dynkin types E6, E7 and E8, Applied\nMathematics and Computation, Vol. 409, 126289, 2021.\n(DOI:10.1016/j.jpaa.2021.106886, arXiv:2006.15405)\n\n*Seminar on Computer Science: Formal Languages and Concurrency*.\n12:00 - 14:00, room L9\n\n*Seminar of the Department of Differential Equations*.\n12:00 - 14:00, room SS2\n*Christian Pötzsche (Universität Klagenfurt - Austria)*.\n*Nonautonomous Bifurcations in Carathéodory Differential Equations*.\nThe classical bifurcation theory of (autonomous) dynamical systems does not apply to differential equations depending explicitly on time because constant solutions typically do not exist and eigenvalues do not indicate stability. Based on bounded entire solutions and the dichotomy (Sacker-Sell) spectrum, as appropriate extensions, we survey a corresponding local nonautonomous bifurcation theory, which, for instance, applies to differential equations allowing only measurable time dependence.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*** Wednesday, May 22, 2024 ***.\n*Mobile Technology Laboratory Seminar*.\n16:00 -
