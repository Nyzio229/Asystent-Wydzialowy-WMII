Their purpose is to prepare participants for:\n* research activities,\n* conduct teaching activities at the academic level,\n* obtaining a doctoral degree in mathematics in the field of mathematics.\n\nCompletion of the doctoral program takes place after passing all the subjects and years of study provided for in the program and obtaining a doctoral degree in mathematics.\n\nWithin the framework of doctoral studies, we offer education in the disciplines of mathematics practiced at our Faculty, at a level that allows you to undertake your own original research. The main subject departments are:\n* Algebra: representation theory of groups and algebras, applications of homological algebra, alternating algebra, actions of groups, invariant theory and theory of Hopf algebras, algebraic and category methods in homotopy theory, algebraic geometry.\n* Nonlinear Analysis and Topology: existence and periodicity problems in ordinary differential equations and differential inclusions, fixed point index and topological degree, topology of multivalued mappings, differential games, variational and topological methods in nonlinear analysis, operator theory.\n* Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems: spectral properties of group actions on spaces with measure, smooth models for dynamical systems, applications of cocycles in ergodic theory, dynamical systems in probability theory, smooth dynamics, topological dynamics.\n* Probability Theory, Stochastic Analysis and Mathematical Statistics: limit theorems of probability theory and stochastic processes, stochastic differential equations, stochastic integral, stochastic geometry, Markov chain-based Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in Bayesian statistics and image recognition, function estimates of positional statistics.",
