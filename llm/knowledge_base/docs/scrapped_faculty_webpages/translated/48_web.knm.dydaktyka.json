During the meetings, we solve interesting tasks, the solution of which requires the use of non-standard methods and a variety of mathematical techniques learned during the course lectures in the first or second year mathematics courses.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Math Olympiad Meetings*.\nWednesdays, 4:15-20:00 pm, room S2: coordinator: Daniel Strzelecki, MA.\nThe classes are designed for high school students. During the meetings interesting and difficult tasks in mathematics are solved, which prepare students for various mathematical competitions. Detailed information can be obtained from the coordinator (e.g., by email: danio@mat.umk.pl). The meetings are held weekly at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Toruń.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Mathematics matriculation courses*.\nThursdays, 6:00 pm - 7:30 pm, rooms: S2, S3 (basic group) and S4, S5 (extended group).\nClasses are designed for high school graduates from Toruń high schools, aimed at repetition and systematization of the material before the matriculation exam in May. In the period from November to April, together with students we solve tasks from matriculation guides, CKE matriculation task books and previous matriculations, focusing on successive sections of school mathematics. We meet weekly in four groups: 2 basic, led by Natalia Trojanowska and Bartosz Osenka, and 2 extended, with leaders: Jakub Wojtasik and Kamil Palusinski. Advance registration for the courses is required at the following email address: kursykzm@gmail.com. In the body of your application, please include your first name, last name, school and the level of your high school diploma.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Academic year 2016/2017*.\n*Pi number day*.\n2017-03-15, Author: Ewelina Betlejewska-Szulc\nOn the occasion of Pi Day, two posters were prepared for students visiting the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science:The first poster entitled: \"Women in Mathematics\" takes a closer look at the lives of Hypatia of Alexandria, Elena Lucrezi Cornaro Piscopia (the first woman to earn a doctorate), Sophia Kowalewska (the first woman with a doctorate in mathematics and the first lady professor) and Emma Noether. The second poster, on the other hand, titled: \"Do you know how to wonder\", presents the most well-known mathematical curiosities and paradoxes - without detailed explanations, in order to mobilize students to do their own investigations.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Correct proof of the formula for the area of a circle and the limit of sin(x)/x*.\n2017-01-18, Author: Janusz Schmude\nThe vast majority of proofs of the formula for the area of a circle use the value of the limit sin(x)/x. In addition, there is a , \"inverse\" fact. Most proofs of the value of this limit use the formula for the area of a circle. The paper will present a proof of the above two facts, which does not contain the mentioned error in reasoning.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Academic year 2015/2016*.\n*About retractions and extensions of mappings*.\n2015-12-02, Author: Prof. Dr. Gregory Gabor\nOf great interest to mathematicians is the question of whether certain properties of a space (set) are inherited by its subsets, alternatively - by what type of subsets. It turns out that some important topological properties are inherited by sets called retracts. The paper will deal with the concepts of retract, ambient retract and strong deformation retract, properties of retracts, as well as important classes of spaces called absolute retracts and absolute ambient retracts. The relationship between the phenomenon of retraction and the phenomenon of mapping extension will be shown. The paper will be richly illustrated with examples to make the introduced concepts easy to grasp for any student familiar with the concept of continuity of functions and metric spaces.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The power of one second? - The mystery of Gamma Euler Functions*.\n2015-10-21, Author: Ewelina Betlejewska\nEach of us knows what a mathematical object is a power. We can treat it as a function: n -> n! But what if we extended this function to real or even composite arguments? As a result of this experiment, we would get the title Gamma function, which, over the centuries, starting with Euler, has occupied the minds of the most brilliant mathematicians. The paper will cover the most important facts about the Gamma function and its interesting applications.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Lesser known facts about the entangled function*.\n2015-01-28, Author: Robert Skiba\nWe are all familiar with the classical theorem of the entangled function. However, in general, knowledge ends with this theorem.... During the paper, I am going to present (almost unknown to anyone!) equivalent formulations of the entangled function theorem and present non-trivial generalizations that have numerous applications in the theory of differential equations.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The admirable number of Pi*.\n2015-01-07, Author: Ewelina Betlejewska\nThe purpose of the paper is to present the understanding of the number Pi throughout history, starting with ancient records and ending with modern attempts to approximate it as accurately as possible. A polemic on the criminality and measurability of the number Pi will explain the unattainability of both the squaring of the circle and the finite expansion of the number Pi.The paper will be supplemented with information on the occurrence of the number Pi in culture and art. It will also present its versatile application in mathematical, physical and astronomical sciences. In addition, an attempt to answer the questions: how many digits of the expansion of Pi are we able to remember? Does it store information about the date of our birth? Can an unquantifiable number conceal certain regularities? The whole discussion will be supported by numerous examples, which will allow for a thorough understanding of the topic under discussion.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Academic year 2014/2015*.\n*A few words about the number e*.\n2014-10-22, Author: Janusz Schmude\nIn the paper we will get acquainted with the definition of the number *e*, and methods of approximating it. The conclusion of these considerations will be the statement of the (non?)measurability of *e*. I will prove that using facts about limits and series learned in the first(!) year, interesting conclusions can be obtained.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
