The process of decision-making and planning business strategies must be based on knowledge extracted from data. This makes it possible to obtain the information and conclusions desired by companies and institutions, often serving to improve the profitability of operations or even crucial for staying in business.\n\nDue to the enormous size and diverse type of data generated by information systems, knowledge of advanced statistics and machine learning techniques is required to analyze them. Hence the high demand for data analysis specialists in the labor market. This is evident on online portals specializing in professional-business contacts (such as LinkedIn) or job portals. In the ranking of the best professions in 2021 (link: https://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/best-jobs-2021?page=0) published by CareerCast, the first position was occupied by a data analyst, and the profession of statistician was ranked third.\n\nIn the study of the second degree program in Data Analysis, we guarantee a solid education in statistics and data mining with elements of computer science. As their graduate - a master's degree in data analysis - you will gain an advantage in the job market.\n\n*** What does the study of Data Analysis give you? ***\n* Education in data analysis based on knowledge of the latest machine learning and data mining techniques and selected IT tools.\n* Ability to work on projects, including team projects.\n* A good profession.\n\n*** Study Program ***\n\nThe study program covers a range of issues related to data analysis, and the graduate will gain knowledge of\n* working with data - from computer aspects, to working with massive data sets, to data visualization issues,\n* mathematical statistics - including biostatistics, Bayesian statistics and time series analysis,\n* advanced data mining techniques such as text mining, neural networks and deep learning issues,\n* programming in the R environment and Python language.\n\nGraduates will be able to apply the acquired theoretical knowledge to formulate, analyze and solve practical tasks in the field of widely understood statistics and data analysis.\n\n*** Why is it worth studying in Toru≈Ñ? ***\n\nNicolaus Copernicus University in Torun is one of the youngest, but already a major university in the country. In 2019 it was included in the list of 10 leading scientific centers in Poland, gaining the status of a research university. Torun is also one of the most important mathematical centers in Poland - in 2017, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun was ranked for the first time in the prestigious ranking of universities in the world - the so-called Shanghai ranking - in the research area: mathematics. Employees of the Nicolaus Copernicus University collaborate scientifically with scientists from leading mathematical centers in the world.\n\nThe Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science has a positive institutional rating from the Polish Accreditation Commission - valid until 2021 - covering all fields of study. According to the ranking of the Perspektywy educational portal, the Mathematics major was ranked 7th in the country (5th among majors taught at universities). We also successfully conduct studies in the fields of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. The most talented students are covered by individual scientific supervision.\n\nWe offer excellent infrastructure:\n\n* lecture and seminar rooms (including a modern auditorium for 350 people), computer laboratories, a student club and a bar,\n* one of the best computer systems in Polish universities,\n* a well-equipped library with a reading room - there are all the basic items of mathematical and computer literature needed by students during their studies,\n* full facilities for the disabled (ramps, elevator, toilets, adapted laboratories).\n\n*** What after studying for a degree in Data Analysis? ***\n\nA job awaits a graduate of Data Analysis in positions that require the use of statistical tools and methods, programming skills, working with large data sets, knowledge of the latest machine learning techniques and the ability to think independently and analytically. These types of specialists are sought after by the financial, insurance, medical, industry, trade, statistical institutions, etc. The labor market needs in this area are huge and the salaries offered are very high.",
