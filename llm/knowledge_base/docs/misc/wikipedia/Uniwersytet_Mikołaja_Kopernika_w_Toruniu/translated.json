The university operates a research station on Spitsbergen, and also manages the University High School in Torun. According to the ranking of higher education institutions of the Perspektywy monthly, one of the best Polish universities, as well as one of the ten Polish research universities - in 2019 the university was awarded the title of research university in the competition \"Initiative of Excellence - Research University\", organized by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.\n== Characteristics ==\nUMK is among the largest universities in Poland, both in terms of the number of students and the fields of study offered. The university is authorized to confer doctoral degrees in 25 scientific disciplines and postdoctoral degrees in 22 disciplines. In 2017, the university employed 4354 people, including 2228 research and teaching staff. This group includes more than 500 independent researchers - professors and postdoctoral fellows. Nearly 25,000 students studied at 17 faculties and the Interdisciplinary Center for Modern Technologies at UMK in 2017, studying 113 majors, 79 courses and postgraduate studies, and 24 types of doctoral studies.\n== History ==\n=== The establishment of the University of Science and Technology ===\nIn February 1945, government delegate Dr. Henryk Swiatkowski proposed the establishment of a university in Torun. The university was intended to activate the region academically and culturally, compensate for the loss of Polish culture after the liquidation of Stefan Batory University in Vilnius and Jan Kazimierz University in Lviv, educate cadres for the national economy and culture, and develop the repolonization campaign in northern Poland. Prof. Ludwik Kolankowski acted on behalf of the professors from Vilnius.\nFrom April 1945, the preparatory work for the establishment of the university was led by an organizing committee headed by Dr. Henryk Swiatkowski. In May and June, the draft organizational structure of the future university was approved. In mid-July, a group of professors, assistants, administrative and library staff of Stefan Batory University arrived in Toruń. Initially, the organization of the university in Toruń was handled by Prof. Jan Wilczynski, but after a month he delegated these duties to Prof. Ludwik Kolankowski. The decree of the Council of Ministers on the establishment of the Nicolaus Copernicus University was approved on August 24, 1945.\nUnder the decree, the university had two faculties: Humanities (with a Fine Arts Section) and Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The structure of the university differed from the intentions of the organizers, who planned to establish a multi-departmental university. On November 5, 1945, the Faculty of Law and Economics was established, and on January 24, 1946, the Fine Arts Section was transformed into an independent Faculty of Fine Arts. The establishment of the new faculties was made possible by attracting professors from the Universities of Lviv, Poznań and Cracow. On October 3, 1945, enrollment at the UMK began. The first lectures were held on October 24. They were conducted by professors Tadeusz Czezowski and Stefan Srebrny. On January 5, 1946, the ceremonial inauguration of the first academic year took place. The city donated several buildings to the University (in 1945, Collegium Maius, Collegium Minus, and a building at 30 Sienkiewicza Street), which were in need of major renovations.\n=== UMK activities from 1945 to 1989 ====.\nUntil 1948, the main task of the UMK authorities was to prepare the necessary conditions for scientific and teaching work. In May 1947, UMK received buildings on Grudziądzka Street (for the chairs of chemistry and physics) and on Chopin Street (for the University Library). In 1948-1949, construction of the Astronomical Observatory in Piwnice began.\nIn 1948, studies were held in 22 faculties. The number of students was about 3.1 thousand. Organizations of conferences, conventions were started, doctorates and habilitations were conducted, the University itself joined the cultural life of Toruń.\nIn 1949, UMK came under strict political control. In 1951, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was divided into the Faculty of Biology and Earth Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. In 1953, the Faculty of Law was abolished. In the Faculty of Humanities, most of the faculties were eliminated, leaving only History and Polish Studies. For political reasons, several professors (including Konrad Górski and Henryk Elzenberg) were removed from teaching. In the mid-1950s, the Study of Foreign Languages and the Study of Physical Education were established.\nAfter Polish October 1956, the ousted professors were reinstated and the organizational structure was expanded. In 1958, the Faculty of Law was reinstated. In the early 1960s, UMK revived contacts with foreign universities. In June 1959, Swedish astronomer Prof. Bertil Lindblad became the first foreign scientist to receive an honorary doctorate from UMK. In the 1960s, four student dormitories were built, followed by observatory pavilions in the Cellars. In 1965, the authorities of Toruń handed over part of the building at Teatralny Square to the University for history and (in the following years) economics. In 1962, the central authorities decided to finance the construction of the campus. In 1963-1965, plans were drawn up for the construction of an academic campus in Bielany. The plan was approved in March 1967, and work began on June 9. The campus was put into operation on October 2, 1973. It was the first complex of buildings of this type in Poland.\nIn 1966-1976 there was a major development of the University. The construction of the campus was combined with the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus. The first stage of campus construction was carried out in 1967-1973, with the commissioning of new premises for the University Library (December 31, 1972), the Institute of Biology and Chemistry (December 31, 1972), as well as the Assembly Hall (December 31, 1972), the Rector's Office with the Foreign Language Study (December 31, 1971), new student dormitories, two assistant hotels, a canteen, a gymnasium, and medical clinic premises. A radio astronomy center was expanded in the basement. The Copernican Year, held in 1973, contributed to the increased popularity of UMK in Poland and abroad. In 1968, the Institute of Economics was established, 10 years later transformed into the Faculty of Economic Sciences.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the university stopped investments, and some scientists were dismissed during martial law. Construction of the Faculty of Economic Sciences building began. A 15-meter-high RT3 radio telescope was completed in Piwnice and construction of a second, RT4, began.\n=== UMK activities after 1989 ====.\nThe political and socio-economic changes of 1989 contributed to the expansion of the University's autonomy and a change in operating principles. In the 1990s, the UMK had a strong momentum of development in various spheres of activity. In 1991, the edifice of the Faculty of Economics and Management was put into use, in November 1994, the RT4 radio telescope was put into operation, a hotel building (which was converted into a student house), a building for the Institute of Pedagogy and the Department of Logic, and the \"Prząśniczka\" club for the benefit of the Faculty of Fine Arts were purchased. The provincial authorities donated the Cat's Head Tower to the Nicolaus Copernicus University, where the Institute of Philosophy was located. Expansion of the University Library and construction of a new building of the Faculty of Law and Administration began. At the end of 2000, the Faculty of Law and Administration building was put into use. In the 1990s, the university was computerized.\nOn September 1, 1993, the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry was divided into three new faculties: Physics and Astronomy, Mathematics and Computer Science, and Chemistry. The Faculty of Historical Sciences was separated from the Faculty of Humanities. On January 1, 1997, the Center for Astronomy was established, with Professor Aleksander Wolszczan as its head. In September 1999, the Faculty of Philology was established.\nAfter 2000, the University of Nicolaus Copernicus received several new buildings: on Batory Street, where the Faculty of Political Science and Security was located, on the area of the decommissioned Torun Merinotex Cottage Spinning Mill, where the Institute of Archeology and the Department of Ethnology were located. In 2001, the National Laboratory of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics was established. In the same year, UMK, together with the Scientific Society of Toruń and the City of Toruń, began organizing the Festival of Science and Art. On October 1, 2001, the Faculty of Theology was established. On November 24, 2004, there was a merger with the Ludwik Rydygier Medical Academy in Bydgoszcz. The faculties of the Medical Academy formed the UMK Medical College. In 2006, the second building of the Faculty of Biology and Earth Sciences was put into use.\nIn 2007, the Faculty of Pedagogical Sciences was established, and in 2009 the Faculty of Political Science and International Studies. In 2011, the Collegium Humanisticum was put into operation and the Center for Quantum Optics was established. In 2012, the Interdisciplinary Center for Modern Technologies was built and the Academic Center for Culture and the Arts \"Od Nowa\" was expanded. In 2019, UMK obtained the status of a Research University, and in 2020 it became a full member of the Young Universities for the Future of Europe consortium.\n== Structure ==\n=== Faculties ===\nAs of October 1, 2019, UMK is divided into 16 faculties:\nFaculty of Chemistry\nFaculty of Philosophy and Social Sciences\nFaculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science\nFaculty of Humanities\nFaculty of Mathematics and Informatics\nFaculty of Biological and Veterinary Sciences\nFaculty of Economic Sciences and Management\nFaculty of Historical Sciences\nFaculty of Political Science and Security\nFaculty of Earth Sciences and Spatial Management\nFaculty of Law and Administration\nFaculty of Fine Arts\nFaculty of Theology\nFaculty of Pharmacy\nFaculty of Medicine\nFaculty of Health Sciences (Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz)\n===All-university and interdepartmental units ====\nNational Laboratory of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics\nCenter for Quantum Optics\nInterdisciplinary Center for Modern Technologies\nCenter for Technology Transfer\nInstitute of Veterinary Medicine\nCenter for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (established in 2023)\n=== Research stations ===\nResearch station in Dobiegniewo on the Vistula River\nResearch station in Laska and Drzewież in the Tuchola Forest area\nLimnological station in Ilawa\nResearch station in Popówka\nStation in Koniczynka\nStation in Bachotek\nPolar station\n=== The Astronomical Observatory of the Nicolaus Copernicus University===.\nAstronomical Observatory - an astronomical center of the University, educating students of the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science, as well as serving space observation, scientific research and popularization of knowledge about the universe.\n=== Other ===\nUniversity High School\nAcademic and scientific computer network TORMAN\n== University base ==\n=== Campus ===\nThe largest cluster of UMK buildings is the campus located in Toruń's Bielany district, the construction of which began in the 1960s.
